I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!</p>
					<p>You really think you can fly that thing? Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.</p>
